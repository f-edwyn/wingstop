The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is one of the most widely employed financial models for investment valuation.
It estimates the value of an investment using its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis attempts to adjust for the
time value of money. The time value of money assumes that a dollar that you have today is worth more than a dollar that's
received tomorrow because it can be invested. In order to create a working DCF analysis, several assumptions need to be
created which will be adopted by the model to perform an accurate representation of the data analysis. As a result,
the margin for error within inaccurate estimates lead to flawed calculations. It is critical that the assumptions of the
data model be as solid as possible.

The model estimates the intrinsic value of the Wingstop (WING) stock. The outputted intrinsic value reflects the perceived
worth of the company's stock based on its fundamental financials over the last three years. 

The assumptions were derived from the averages of the pre-existing data found in the last three years supplied by yfinance.
Several calculations have been deferred from the original model to account for the dataset and accurately representation
the price expectations.
